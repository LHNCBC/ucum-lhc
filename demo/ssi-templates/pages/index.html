      <h1 id="overview-title">The UCUM-LHC Library Overview</h1>

      <p>The UCUM-LHC library is a javascript library that provides validation and
      conversion services for the <a href="http://unitsofmeasure.org">Unified Code for
      Units of Measure</a> (UCUM) code system created by the Regenstrief Institute, Inc.</p>

      <p>The UCUM code system describes "all units of measures being contemporarily
      used in international science, engineering, and business" (from the
      <a href="http://unitsofmeasure.org/trac/">Unified Code for Units of Measure</a>
      description).  The UCUM system uses dimensional analysis for conversion of
      commensurable units, which eliminates the need to hardcode conversion functions
      for most units.  In addition, the UCUM system accomodates validation of
      unit codes built on other unit codes, e.g., mg/kg/h (milligram per killogram
      per hour).</p>

      <h3>See the code in action</h3>

      <p>Check out our <a href="demo.html">
        demonstration page</a> that illustrates the validation and conversion
        functions of the UCUM-LHC library.</p>


      <h3>Using the UCUM-LHC Code</h3>

      <p>The UCUM-LHC library can be downloaded and installed as a
        <a href="http://bower.io">bower</a> package or an
        <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/@lhncbc/ucum-lhc">npm</a> package.
        The installed dist/ucum-lhc.js module package includes the code you need
        for the validation and conversion functions as well as the UCUM code
        definitions file.  The UCUM-LHC code provides validation and conversion
        capabilities for units of measure.  Those functions are accessed from the
        ucumPkg.UcumLhcUtils class.  Descriptions of those functions are included
        in the README.md file in the UCUM-LHC
        <a href="https://github.com/lhncbc/ucum-lhc">GitHub</a> repository.</p>

        <h3>Clone the ucum-lhc repository from GitHub</h3>


      <p>You may clone the ucum-lhc repository from GitHub
        <a href="https://github.com/lhncbc/ucum-lhc">here</a>.  The repository
      includes all the code found in the ucum-lhc bower package as well as
      supporting code in the form of test code, data import/export code,
      and the code for the demo site.  Instructions for cloning a GitHub
      repository are on the GitHub page.</p>
